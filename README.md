# Passify-Pro 🎟️💥

Welcome to **Passify-Pro** – the **plugin that will change your life**. Seriously, who knew event tickets could be so sleek, so secure, and so easy? If **Google Wallet** tickets were a sport, we’d be *undefeated champions*. 🏆⚡

This is **Passify-Pro**: The most **elegant, revolutionary, and indispensable** WordPress plugin to ever exist. We took a long, hard look at what the world needed, and we said, “Why not make Google Wallet tickets as **smooth** as butter on a hot pancake?” 🍯🥞 You’re welcome.

🚨 **PSA**: This is still a **work-in-progress**, but it’s so good that you’ll think it’s finished. We’re still working out the kinks, but you’ll barely notice because you’ll be too busy *freaking out over how awesome it is*. 🚨

## What Does This Thing Do? 🤔

- **Generates Google Wallet Tickets**: That's right, **Google Wallet** passes on auto-pilot. 🎟️ We’ve automated it, so you don’t have to.
- **Service Key Encryption**: You’ll upload your service account key, and we’ll **keep it encrypted** like it’s a **top-secret mission**. 🔐
- **User Data? Yup!**: Your users' **name, email, phone number** – all the info you want, automatically pulled from WordPress and added to their passes. 📱
- **QR Code Redemption**: Each ticket comes with a QR code for easy redemption. **Just scan and go**. So easy, your grandma could do it (if she were into event tickets). 📱➡️🛂
- **Role-Based Redemption**: Want only **certain users** to redeem tickets? We’ve got you covered. Only the right roles get access. 🎟️🔒
- **Metadata Mapping**: Dynamically populate event details like name, date, ticket number… You know, the important stuff. 🗓️
