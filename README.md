# Passify-Pro 🎟️💥

Welcome to **Passify-Pro** – the **plugin that will change your life**. Seriously, who knew event tickets could be so sleek, so secure, and so easy? If **Google Wallet** tickets were a sport, we’d be *undefeated champions*. 🏆⚡

This is **Passify-Pro**: The most **elegant, revolutionary, and indispensable** WordPress plugin to ever exist. We took a long, hard look at what the world needed, and we said, “Why not make Google Wallet tickets as **smooth** as butter on a hot pancake?” 🍯🥞 You’re welcome.

🚨 **PSA**: This is still a **work-in-progress**, but it’s so good that you’ll think it’s finished. We’re still working out the kinks, but you’ll barely notice because you’ll be too busy *freaking out over how awesome it is*. 🚨

## What Does This Thing Do? 🤔

- **Dynamic Pass Creation**: Create event passes for users who purchase specific products in WooCommerce.
- **Product Category-Based Pass Generation**: Admins can select which product categories will trigger pass generation.
- **Metadata Field Mapping**: Admins can map metadata fields to dynamically build wallet pass classes and objects based on WooCommerce order data.
- **Decrypted Service Account Key Storage**: The service account key used to authenticate with Google Wallet is securely encrypted and only decrypted during API calls.
- **Custom Expiration Date**: If no expiration date is provided, passes will have a default expiration date of one week after purchase.
- **Rotating QR Codes**: The generated passes include rotating QR codes, which are used as redemption links.
- **Secure Redemption Process**: Only authorized roles (e.g., employees) can redeem tickets through a custom redemption API, with strict security validation.

### Admin Features:
- **Admin Settings Page**: An interface where admins can upload the Google service account key, select metadata fields, and define which product categories should trigger pass generation.
- **Log Viewing**: Admins can view logs detailing the creation and management of passes.
- **Metadata Field Configuration**: Admins can select and create metadata fields to dynamically build Google Wallet passes.
